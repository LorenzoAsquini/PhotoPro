# PhotoPro

- App available on the Google Play Store: [PhotoPro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.project_photopro).
- The app was developed with the goal of utilizing the features provided by [CameraX]([https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/camera](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax)) and [Camera2](https://developer.android.com/training/camera2) on Android.

## Features

- The app can be used to take photos using the different features provided:
  - Flash: The flash can be on, off, automatic, or always on.
  - Frame Averaging: It is possible to take a photo by averaging multiple consecutive frames. The number of frames inside the average can be set in the settings menu.
  - Smart Delay: It is possible to take a photo after a countdown. The countdown starts when a person is recognized in front of the camera. The duration of the timer can be set in the settings menu.
  - Night Mode: It is possible to activate or deactivate the night mode, or to set the night mode to automatic. This possibility will make the camera automatically switch to night mode in low-light conditions.
  - HDR, Bokeh, Face Retouch: Inside the settings menu, it is possible to decide whether to use an extension when taking a photo. If night mode is active, any other extension is not used.
  - Pro Mode: It is possible to take photos by setting the desired ISO and shutter speed. The maximum shutter speed allowed is 500 ms (1/2).

## Notes

  - Depending on the device used, the extensions (Night Mode, HDR, Bokeh, Face Retouch) may not be available. This depends on the manufacturer's decision to make the extension available.
